        "3. **Fine-Tuning Transfer Learning:-** is when you take the underlying patterns (also called weights) of a pre-trained model and adjust them to your problem. This means **training some, many or all layers** in pretrained model. This is applicable in scenarios where you have relatively large dataset and **your data is slightly different** from the original data on which the model was trained.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "A common practice is to **Freeze** all the learned patterns in bottom layers of a **pretrained model** so that they become **un-trainable**. Then, the top 2-3 layers of the **pre-trained** model can adjust its output to our customer data (**feature extraction**).\n",
        "As you have trained the **top layers** you can gradually **unfreeze** more and more layers and run the training process on your own data to further **fine-tune**it.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Lower Layers** in a computer vision model learns **large features**. In a cat and dog classification they might learn the **outline of legs** while the layers closer to the output might learn **shape of the teeth.**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "So, in **Feature Extraction** only the top 2-3 layers change but in **Fine Tuning Model** many or all of the original model get changed.\n",
